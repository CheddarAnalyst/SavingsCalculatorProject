#A program for Alice
#You've now calculated that working part-time, Bob can still save up about $8k yearly, so Bob can indeed live this way.

#Working part-time, Bob now has more time for dating. He meets Alice and wants to show her the program.

#Alice earns $30/hour, works 45 hours per week for 46 weeks per year, and spends $500 each week. Change the variables and figure out Alice's yearly earnings.

# --- Display a greeting ---
greeting = "Hello "
name = "Alice"
print(greeting + name)

# --- Calculate the yearly income ---

hourly_wage = 30
hours_per_week = 45
income_per_week = hourly_wage * hours_per_week
weeks_per_year = 46
income_per_year = weeks_per_year * income_per_week


print(name + "'s yearly income is:")
print(income_per_year)

# --- Calculate the yearly spend ---
spend_per_week = 500
spend_per_year = spend_per_week * 52
print(name + "'s yearly spend is:")
print(spend_per_year)


# --- Calculate the yearly savings ---
income_per_year = weeks_per_year * income_per_week
spend_per_year = spend_per_week * 52
savings_per_year = income_per_year - spend_per_year
print(name + "'s yearly savings:")
print(savings_per_year)
